# yauction-product-picker
To display specific promotion module, users might like to pick products to list by themselves. That's why I design &lt;yauction-product-picker /> to fulfill this request. With &lt;yauction-product-picker />, users could search products by keyword &amp; category easily. Besides that, &lt;yauction-product-picker /> also provide property and method to switch seller role and setting. Infinite scroll feature has already built with it and user could browse product cells smoothly.
